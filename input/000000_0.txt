tt1631867This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, It feels like a silly video game that you keep playing again n again till you are able to crack the problem. Time travel capacity lost due to Blood Transfusion!! Can't think of something sillier? Only the last 10-15 minutes was worth paying any money for. 3 D effect was good, but playing the same storyline on loop is the dumbest thing ever! I wonder how it got such great reviews in IMDb, which is otherwise quite reliable. The premise of the story itself is flawed, has no scientific basis and why on earth would Tom Cruise be starting over at the same point in Time? Does he have control over what time he can start over? How would the Brain retain any information if it is time traveling? Is the brain impervious to time? The Aliens looked so silly too, hardly looked the smart technological beings who can control time. The Armour of human soldiers looked impressive, but too heavy and clunky for practical use, but is realistic and portrays current state of the art research. The movie fails to generate any emotions or thrill. Just boring Shoot. Die. Reboot.
tt1631867shame as pedigree was good /stars /director/ but it was all computer effects and poor little story,in fact 'saving private Ryan' undertones. like lots, take out the effects and whats left? Emily blunt is a exceptional actress but wasted here London trafalgar squares the only piece that is real and looks so so effects out and zero. acting OK, convincing. but thats all the reviews are from under 21s at a guess' the effects are good, but constant would have loved a little more storyline, and less action, action is best when you are involved, this didn't involve us at all sorry tom better next time. hope your mission next is also better than last.
tt1631867There are a number of reasons why 'Edge of Tomorrow', a Tom Cruise sci- fi action-adventure vehicle, did quite well at the box office in 2014. Primarily it's the overall concept: a 'Groundhog Day' mixed with the alien invasion genre. Cruise adopts a variation of the 'Bill Murray' role, playing a former advertising executive turned public relations officer for the US Army, and assigned to a United Nations-like 'United Defense Army', who have been entrusted with the difficult task of battling a bunch of nasty aliens who have taken over almost the entire European continent. Cruise plays 'Major' William Cage and he's similar to the narcissistic Phil Connors in 'Groundhog Day'. Both must go through the trial of time repeating itself before they develop the insight to change their personalities. Connors' character flaw that he must overcome, is misanthropy; Cage, on the other hand, must overcome not only his lack of competence as a soldier, but his 'cowardice'. It's General Brigham who sees through Cage's phoniness and lack of bravery right away and has him arrested after an escape attempt; as punishment, Cage is stripped down to the rank of private, and finds himself assigned to a forward operating unit at Heathrow Unit in London, about to be shipped off the battlefield on the French beaches. Cage ends up under the charge of Master Sergeant Farrell who bullies him continually after learning that he's labeled as a 'deserter'; Cage meets the various soldiers, who he ends up fighting with against the aliens on the beaches of France. Cage is petrified as he's parachuted down on to the field of battle. Before being almost immediately killed by one of the aliens (called Alphas, larger aliens who command the foot soldiers, the Mimics), he meets Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who tells him to seek her out, when he 'wakes up'. The film becomes much more engrossing and entertaining when Cage suddenly wakes up and finds himself back at Heathrow and being escorted once again by Sergeant Farrell to meet the same fellow soldiers he met before. He realizes he's in some kind of time loop but doesn't know why. In order to meet up with Sgt. Vrataski, he must find a way to escape from his platoon and there's some comedy thrown in when he tries to sneak underneath a truck and gets crushed, only to have Sgt. Farrell quip, "What the hell were you thinking?" But after getting killed, we see Cage make a second attempt going under the truck, and this time he makes it. Cage hooks up with Vrataski who puts him through a grueling training course to learn how to successfully navigate his way through the battlefield against the mimics. Each time he fails, she finishes him off with a bullet from her gun and he goes through the same training, eventually perfecting his craft as a warrior. Vrataski also introduces Cage to Dr. Carter who explains how he came to acquire the power to continually to go through the time loops. The explanation proves that the film's premise is not grounded in science but rather fantasyso for those Ingmar Bergman aficionados out there, do not be disappointed if this explanation doesn't turn out to be 'rocket science'. Cage ended up getting sprayed by the blood of an Alpha after he killed it in battle and somehow, since the Alphas are hooked into the hive mind, the Omega (who controls the time looping ability), that somehow allows him to take over the Omega's fantastic power. This power can only become undone if one ends up getting a blood transfusion (which is exactly what happened to Vrataski before, when she was wounded on the battlefield and brought to a field hospital!). Obviously getting too caught up in analyzing the pseudo-science behind the whole time-looping premise, will only detract from the enjoyable machinations to come. Cage, now fully a 'battle machine', has been clued in about the Omega's visions, which may lead him to where the 'queen bee' is hiding. After several scenarios on the beach where Vrataski keeps getting killed, he decides to proceed inland himself, but discovers that the Omega hiding out at a German dam, is only a ruse. The plot now thickens when Cage, Vrataski and Carter decide to lift a 'prototype' which has been developed at the Ministry of Defense, to locate the Omega. That seems rather convenient but there's enough 'action' along the way, to keep your interest. And this is when Cage is injured and ends up getting a blood transfusion, losing his power to reset each day. The climax is slightly anti-climactic. Cage of course finds out where the Omega is hiding (under the Louvre of all places!) and must destroy the big blob in order to disconnect the rest of the interconnected Alphas and Mimics. This whole idea of an interconnected hive, tied to a controlling 'brain' (and forcing the good guys to destroy it) has been done ad infinitum. Cases in point: the Borg series in Star Trek: Next Generation (with the 'brain' taking over the body of Picard and now calling himself 'Locutus') and 'Vikki', the chief operating system in 'I Robot'. Since Cage gets splattered with the Omega's blood after it explodes, he gets one more reset. This time he wakes up where it's announced that a 'power surge' in Paris causes a cessation in all alien activitythe threat is neutralized. Cage is now back being a major and meets Vrataski, who of course, doesn't recognize him. In addition to the enjoyable plot and pulsating electronica score, 'Edge of Tomorrow' features some neat battle suit designs (based on real-world exoskeleton initiatives), as if appropriated from an 'apocalyptic' Mad Max set. Kudos to Mr. Cruise for the excellent stunts. 'Edge' maintains its edge despite the hokey premise and a few clichés along the way. Definitely worth a look!
tt1631867Now I know that I may be a little late with this review but I missed this one in cinemas and I was bummed out because this one looked really good and I was right. To start off this movies proves that Tom Cruise still has some action movies left in him because he is starting to become an older action hero, but this movie has turned the tables (now just give me Mission Impossible 5). Another thing that this movie did well was the ability to restart the day because that is what movie focused on and it nailed it. Another positive that this movie did was the relationship between Tom Cruise's character and Emily Blunt's character, because it was cool to see how his feeling were growing for her character but she had just met this guy each time so of course she wouldn't remember him. Their some bits that could have improved like maybe getting to know a few more characters because I couldn't remember the rest of the characters beside Tom Cruise's and Emily Blunt's characters. But overall Edge of Tomorrow is a great Sci-Fi movie and this years Elysium so I say go out their and buy it on Blu-ray now.
tt1631867An excellent premise that is carried by Tom Cruise throughout. If you don't know what the premise is, then go into the film that same way. That way, you can follow Cruise's character as he finds out what's going on himself. Even with knowing, Cruise sells the premise very well, and he is the key element in the film. Without him, "Edge of Tomorrow" would be good, but more of a standard science-fiction movie. The other characters run from underdeveloped to one note. It's fun to see Bill Paxton as a tough Sargent, when many of us remember him as the freaked-out grunt from "Aliens!" Otherwise, everyone, including Emily Blunt, don't have much character or shading to them. It's up to Cruise to carry the film, and he does so very well. This is the first Doug Liman movie I've liked since "Swingers." Most of his movies are colorless, passionless affairs that are more productions than movies with any soul. He does better here, driven probably by the presence of Cruise. The screen writing is great, especially towards the beginning as the plot and the premise unfold. The editing is also very good. The trick is, once we know what's going on, and what needs to be done to fight the aliens, we're kind of just hanging out until the end. So, the last half is definitely less interesting than the first. But, the opening is very good, and the film is worth a watch. NOTE: The 3-D is good. But, Liman and cinematographer Dion Beebe are unfortunately too much into the shaky-cam thing for their own good. And, it makes the 3-D too jittery an experience, which is unfortunate. ******* (7 Out of 10 Stars)
tt1631867Despite his questionable religious beliefs, cringe-worthy talk show appearances, and all-round general creepiness, one cannot deny the raw star power of Tom Cruise, even a shocking 28 years since his breakthrough in Top Gun (1986). Here, he brings charm to an instantly dislikeable character - a cowardly, smarmy PR major who hasn't seen a second of combat in a world battling invading alien forces. His performance - possibly one of the best in his long career - shows his true range as his character goes through a highly convincing arc from pathetic rookie to fully-fledged action hero. It's easy to forget that Cruise is a highly accomplished actor, and there is no-one better out there to spear-head a blockbuster. As humanity prepares for a surprise attack on an alien force called Mimics who have devastated many of the large cities on Earth, General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders public affairs officer Major William Cage (Cruise) to cove r the combat from the front lines during the assault. Objecting that his life will be placed in danger, Cage is arrested, labelled as a deserter, and wakes up handcuffed in the hands of Master Sergeant Farrell (Bill Paxton), a Southern drill instructor with a strange sense of humour. Cage is suited and booted with hi- tech armour and dropped into the battle, which turns out to be a disaster for the humans and they are overrun by the Mimics, who decimate their forces. Cage manages to kill a rare large Mimic, and is killed in return when the Mimic's acid-like blood dissolves his face. He then wakes up handcuffed, and again meets Master Sergeant Farrell, who appears to have never met him. The day plays out like it did before, and once again Cage is dropped into the battlefield only to be killed again, this time surviving a little longer. It's on the battlefield that he meets famous soldier Rita 'Full Metal B***h' Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who seems to recognise his ability to anticipate events and tells him to seek her out, before they are both killed again. Cage tracks her down on the base, and Rita informs him that he is stuck in a time-loop, something she experienced after a previous battle with the Mimics but has since lost due to a blood transfusion. The two start to work together, with Cage training to survive a little bit more every time he dies. Adapted from the Japanese light novel All You Need is Kill (a title the film adopted before it changed to the generic Edge of Tomorrow - something that may have been the cause for it's underwhelming box- office performance), the film clearly takes inspiration from video games. Every time your character dies, it starts again from the beginning of the level or checkpoint, where you can use your experience to gain the skill required to complete the level. While this can be frustrating and monotonous when bashing a game controller, Edge of Tomorrow doesn't linger on the repetitiveness of Cage's day, and instead moves the story along to the point where you don't even know how many times Cage has lived the same day. Each time, Cage learns to duck here, fire there, take a different route; and director Doug Liman revels in killing off his hero in a variety of ways to an often comedic effect. The first two-thirds of the movie are delightfully entertaining, with the Mimics proving to be inventive creations, resembling giant, tentacled tumbleweeds, and the movie wisely choosing not to get bogged down in time-loop mumbo- jumbo. Emily Blunt, one of the most charismatic and beautiful actresses working at the moment, is excellent, portraying a female lead who, for once, isn't there simply for the male hero to rescue and fall in love with, but is the key to any hopes of success. Which is all the more disappointing when the movie begins to bow to convention during the final third, as Vrataski starts to fall for our vertically- challenged protagonist. As with most recent blockbusters, Edge of Tomorrow also struggles at the climax. The inventiveness of the Groundhog Day approach (I almost made it through the entire review without mentioning the Bill Murray classic) makes way for a familiar, simplistic climax and a roll-your-eyes bittersweet final scene, It's sad, because this could have been one of the best blockbusters in the past couple of years; a twist on the usual crash-bang-wallop alien invasion flick. It does, however, offer plenty of great action, bolstered by a fine sense of humour, and proves that Tom Cruise can still convincingly anchor a big-budget action movie, even at the ripe old age of 52. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
tt1631867Not so long ago men were ready to hit the beaches of France and take on Nazi aggression. Times may have changed, but the allied forces, this time called the United Defence Force, are hitting those same beaches, to rid our world from aliens! There is a twist though, Major Cage (Tom Cruise) has to do this over and over and over as he is stuck in a time loop, which is a good thing, as he has no combat training whatsoever... he is a PR guy who like the gentlemen raising money for war bonds, excites the young and the stupid to fight the good fight. Is the movie worth it? Yes! There are well filmed action sequences. The film is not repetitive given that the Major has to fight the same day over and over, until he is forced to make one final push that ultimately leads to the ending, and there's Emily Blunt, who is quite cute generally and quite sexy in uniform (or mech armour). Take this one for what it is, a sci-fi action movie, that is fun, entertaining, and worth the entrance fee, or the rental price if watching it at home on your HD TV, which I recommend over a cinema anyway! Have fun watching!
tt1631867I will start out by saying that I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and I absolutely loved it. I will begin by saying that I love Tom Cruise as an action actor and that he is def in my Top 5 actors of all time. Now to the review. Acting: I will begin by saying that the acting was top notch of course we have Tom Cruise who is Awesome and also Emily Blunt who was Fantastic. I thought the standout was Bill Paxton who was hilarious in the movie and also Brendan Gleeson who was also great with the few parts he had so acting was Superb. Story: The story I thought was very well put together about the alien Invasion and by the end of the movie while there was still one question it was pieced together nicely. Action Scenes: The action in this movie was Insane it was honestly non-stop from start to finish which I love for a movie like this take all the examples you have seen which combine Starship Troopers and the first scene in Saving Private Ryan and combine them and that is what you get an all out brawl of badass action scenes to rival these movies in particular which are Battle:LA and Battleship which I didn't watch because I heard it sucked but regardless if you love action movies this is def for you. Verdict: I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy and action movies galore. I would say watch it in IMAX but if you can't just watch it in 2D this is the summer blockbuster to start the summer and possibly beat out all the rest and in my opinion is Tom Cruise's best film since my personnel favorite "Collateral"!!!!! A Must See.
tt1631867Greetings from Lithuania. "Edge of Tomorrow" (2014) is superb film in all directions. Everything works here so well, that i can safely say, this is the best blockbuster of 2014 (although i haven't see "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" yet). First 40 minutes of this picture are outstanding, later plot moves to next step, which is also superbly crafted. The very last ending of this picture wasn't as good as the rest of the movie, but it was OK. I can praise everything in "Edge of Tomorrow". Directing is great, acting is very solid, production values are a top notch but the real star of "Edge of Tomorrow" is script - very smart, very involving, unexpected and really engaging. No wonder, because the script was written by heavy-weighter Christopher McQuarrie - brilliant job in "Edge of Tomorrow", just brilliant. I was engaged in this film from the very first second till the very last shot, it's that good. Overall, 10/10 for "Edge of Tomorrow" - brilliant script, superb directing, acting and production values - everything clicks here on full cylinders and although a was a slightly disappointed by the very last ending, nevertheless "Edge of Tomorrow" is a must see type of entertainment.
tt1631867I see many movies based on the reviews but it was irony in this case! I heard some reviews saying that no difference was in this film with the other sci-fi's and yet, I went on to watch it just because its a Tom Cruise Sci-Fi. and now, WOW! its very fresh movie although it has Source Code theme (program there, blood here) but its kind of different. I see no other than Tom for this role. This was tailor-made for him. Although many continuity errors are there, the alien thing and Tom cruise distract us enough throughout the movie. Its a great movie to watch in theaters, at least in bluray! I prefer the latter one though. But seriously its a great one! not a cult one though.. My rating - 8/10
tt1631867Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.4/5 stars The conceit may sound constricting, but Director, Doug Liman gets exceptional mileage out of it, presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style, narrative velocity, and a wonderful dose of dark humor. Ultimately, it's is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it exceedingly well to churn out an instant sci-fi classic. The plot deals with an alien race that has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage (Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside special forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt). As Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy. While this premise might sound derivative, be rest assured that the narrative is strewn with copious intricacies and unpredictable moments that demand your attention, lest you be left behind in the adrenaline-pumping, frantic pace of the film. More story than testosterone, more time-jump-cuts than spacey filler, and more war-as-hell than war-as-cool. The biggest achievement of the movies is that it leaves you pondering if we're 'masters of our fate' or just action figures going through the emotions in some supreme player's idea of a war game. Tom Cruise once again shows why he's still a bona-fide movie star and guaran-damn-tees us that he's got at least a few more years of leading man material left in his arsenal. Along with the gorgeous Emily Blunt  in a kick-ass role  he takes you on a (literally) loopy ride that's thoroughly entertaining and  baring a few pardonable moments in the second half  never wears out its welcome. The performances of Cruise and Blunt are spot on, with good supporting work from Bill Paxton, who plays a very hard-headed albeit somewhat humorous sergeant. The film is such a refreshing departure from the run-of-the-mill genre yarns of countless modern sci-fi blockbusters, and offers a fascinating and enjoyable vehicle that creates an ambitious illusion. All in all, a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun, and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we haven't seen the last of him yet. Smart, unpredictable, expertly-designed, well- acted, astutely directed, shrewdly-edited, and boasting impressive special effects, "Edge of Tomorrow" is a model example of the sci-fi genre and summer blockbuster done right.
tt1631867OMG this is the best movie I've ever watched in the last four years since The King's Speech! I thought it would end up like Groundhog Day or Source Code, but hey this is still much better than X-Men: Days of Future Past (hey I'm not degrading the mutants, I'm just comparing their time-travel theme)! I certainly hope that Hollywood will continue to make this kind of movie in the future! And why did it only reach $100 million? Why is this movie not so very popular in the American and world cinemas? Are the average world population that stupid to comprehend the whole story? What's wrong with you people? Is it because of Tom Cruise? I know he's a little bit old and did a little nose and eye bags job, but I don't care how bad his acting was, as long as the story is great. And then I just realized that this is a Japanese story. Now I firmly believe that Japanese people have wilder dream and imaginations than the rest of the world, whereas Hollywood has the better visual effects.
tt1631867Before I watch this movie, I was like 'OHHH!! NO GOOD MOVIES THIS YEAR' except "Divergent" and "Non-Stop", Its excellent and the best for me until I watched This big boom's Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt "Edge of Tomorrow". Tom cruise didn't had big roles this year before this, I'm a big fan of his, the last good movie of his was "Jack Reacher" and even "Oblivion" I didn't like too much. I wanted to see something different, and here it comes, I'm really excited about the movie, I want to watch over and over. I want here to thank writers: Christopher McQuarrie & Jez Butterworth, plus all staff worked on this movie, thank you all you inspired me. PS: I want to mention here that there is some good movies this year but not that good that makes me inspired to write a review about anyone, for example these ones (The Fault in our Stars, Need for speed, Transcendence, 300 Rise of an Empire, Jack Ryan shadow recruit, Ride along, Vampire Academy...)
tt1631867An absolute masterpiece. A bedazzling fresh story. An amazing action-thriller that will freeze you on your seat even until after the credits have long been rolling! I can't put it into words, these are just mere expressions off the top of my head. The story-telling was a work of art, the editing non-such, everything was in the right place. I have not felt this specific rush of excitement in my veins for quite some time. This is the first time I enjoyed a movie like I did with this one since last year. This is one of the best movies I've ever watched, certainly one of the best 2014 had to offer. I rate this 10/10 and I don't do it lightly. I don't just give away 10/10 ratings to any movie. No, this does not happen perhaps more than once a year; surely there have been several movies worth 8/10 or some really good 9/10 ones but there is only one movie that'll just take your breath away and you just know deep down that this is it, this is that "one" 10/10 movie. And I guess that about wraps it for 2014. I present to you "Edge of Tomorrow". I'm definitely gonna watch it over and over again for a long time to come. Do not miss it.
tt1631867I Love the idea of this movie.. you will never regret watching it I assure you. I mean this movie is all about one could ever want in his life..Basically to be GOD. because for me to be able to control time and to relive some moments means to be God! I love this to see in a movie but now when I think about knowing when I will die for real I don't want this to happen..except if I would be able to do just like Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt did in this amazing scenario movie! If any of you have time to watch this movie I suggest you to do because it simply do your day but..On the other hand after you see it there are chances to be a little depressed if you will start to think how it will be if you could control the time..and reset even one day.. it will be amazing if any of us could be able to risk everything in one day with the opportunity if something goes wrong to be able te relive that day and make it how we want it..and I think that I would have had that power..to make one day of my life perfect I would have tried it many times until I will be full of cash.. I mean literally to have money in every bank and seif in this world. But thats just what an 18 year old boy thinks..who knows maybe in a few year or many years I will not think how I think today. See this movie! Brilliant idea!
tt1631867I just watched this movie because of all the buzz around it having a reboot of life. One of the other reason was that i love Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise so i had watch it. This movie is a MASTERPIECE , EXCEPTIONAL but Emotionless. Director Doug Liman shows his brilliant filmmaking again after The Bourne Identity[2002].In the movie,the world is facing an alien invasion and Cage(Tom Cruise) & Rita(Emily Blunt) had to fighting against them to save the world(blah..!!). Well,this movie is based on the same idea as the Source Code[2011] was but a much much better implementation in some important fields of filmmaking.A Very good acting by both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, Wonderful direction by Liman and Exceptional writing.You will see some great visual effects.But the movie has its flaws also.I think the movie has less touch with human emotions.There is hardly a one or two scenes in the movie in which you can see the emotions coming out but the director was unable to catch them properly.May be Liman was so involved with telling the story that he forgot to include the emotions also.Also, I didn't liked the background score its more like a war is coming and something big is happening which is good and according to the movie but at certain time when their is a need for emotional score,background score goes plain. But, nevertheless this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to watch for its good acting,direction and writing.Don't expect any emotions from it...
tt1631867Good Groundhog Day concept, set in a European war against invading aliens. It started out undercooked. We got a quick exposition by network news montage, then a really implausible dilemma for the hero, which was made worse by an unbelievably relaxed military base on the eve of a D-Day style invasion. Lots of details got me thinking that would never happen, never! At this point it felt like the whole thing was held together with sticky tape. The invasion sequence is Saving Private Ryan all over again, but not so much. And then ... the concept kicks in, and it becomes a great story, There's plenty of humour, but it's all gogogo action and the pace hardly flags. The aliens are menacing, better than Starship Trooper. The acting was good, although I think Gleeson was miscast, and the rag-tag troops are a bit lightweight. The hero goes from glib coward to determined saviour, but there's nothing to show why (rather than how) he clicks into action. I know some things have to be glossed over, but there's no explanation of how the rogue troops sneaked off base with a hulking great airplane for the final mission. So I mark it down to 7 for that, but still very enjoyable.
tt1631867This is one of those movies that has high-tech special effects, but combines it with a clever story and direction. It's another movie about humans fighting against a alien race, but the story is just so darn well thought out and clever when it comes to the scenarios. That it actually stands out among other movies of this type. When it comes to the story, it's actually based on a novel called "All You Need Is Kill". The story is like a mix of "Groundhog Day" and a alien invasion movie with mech like suits. For a storyline like this it needs quite a bit of creativity or it gets redundant fast. Fortunately, the creativity of the similar scenarios is what drives this movie. It mixes the right amount of humor and the serious tone of this movie which doesn't go off track. Tom Cruise is a good actor and he is especially good playing these characters that gets built from ground up. I personally think he is a better actor for these sci-fi movies than Will Smith. The action is entertaining and the direction and scenarios are captivating to the point that I would highly recommend this movie to any sci-fi movie fans. Sure there are few plot-holes, but they seem to have at least have tries to make a interesting and intelligent film. You will have a blast with this one. 8.8/10
tt1631867I'm pretty sure it's just me who has this feeling. So when I was looking at the movie, I thought it was just going to be the same thing we've all seen before. However, after reading the graphic novel, I was well surprised at the story and the details that go into it. This got me hyped for the movie like anyone else. After I finished watching it, I felt confused for a moment, as if I had seen another movie. it just didn't appeal to me as much as the book, which explains more of the "barely-hinted spots" of the movie that was actually in the book. Honestly, I'm pretty sure this is a movie that is much better just as a movie alone, but I can't stop comparing it to the book. Others would and probably do like this movie more than me, as the group I went with all said how good the movie is.
tt1631867The story is smart. This kind of movie can work on a smaller scale. They shouldn't make it on such a big budget, causing difficulties to break even. It's unfair when people focus on the failure of box office, not the film itself. However, this movie is far from perfect. I think it's even not entertaining enough. Here is why- 1.It's clever, maybe too clever for general people to catch the crucial points. Many people understand the live-die-repeat thing, but have no idea about how the time loop works, the structure of alien society, or the difference between Alpha and Omega. That's why so many people consider it boring. 2.Tom's role is too far away from the roles he used to play, causing a lot of confusions. His acting is good. But this is not enough for a character building. Screenwriters should do more on the leading role's character development, not leave everything to the actor. 3.Most other actors are completely wasted. I can't believe such a good writer who worked out so many decent supporting characters (in both Valkyrie and Jack Reacher) cannot do it this time. It's a shame. I really start to worry about MI5 now...(I didn't worry and had enough confidence in Christopher McQuarrie until I watch this film) Anyway, it's a nice film. The story telling is smooth and soooo clever. Tom is as good as always. Emily also did a great job. I think many people will enjoy it, although I'm a little disappointed as a TC fan.（Not a good enough film for such a crucial time in his career, it's good, but not good enough)
tt1631867let me start of with the trailer.after the announcement of movie i curiously waited for trailer release but when the trailer was released all my hype on this movie was gone and thought that movie would suck i was surprised with the rating and went to movie on the next day of release... generally,i love every movie that is well presented and executed but this movie is just great. that concept of live,die,repeat is shot perfectly i didn't find a mistake in this movie story of this movie is really good, Tom cruise acting is really good, chemistry between tom cruise and Emily blunt is really really good, basically everything of this movie is good my final word is "don't miss this movie"
tt1631867Actually pretty good action sci-fi. Yet whole premise is so fundamentally wrong that it turns this almost into comedy. Let me just check again what happened, organism has an vulnerability that gives opponent an ability to reset day into eternity until it manages to defeat it. Gimme a break, this is a species that does not survive local pond with 2 frogs let alone climb to the top of the food chain and on route to conquering universe. This is like installing Win95 onto spaceship and expecting everything to run smoothly. So yes, it is actually good if such things don't bother you, ...
tt1631867This is a good movie no doubt, but it's not a copycat? Really it's first of its kind? I can name quite a few predecessors if you guys are interested to know. 1. Groundhog Day (1993), trapped in a time loop to wake up everyday the same day. Ring a bell? 2. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), the dagger can turn back time and the grand reset at the end to the starting point. Can you see the resemblance? 3. Source Code (2011), could it be a same writer for the both movies? I am not sure, but it is the same story, eh? The Aliens looked almost identical as Sentinals in the Matrix. Please don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, highly recommended, go see it!
tt1631867This isn't a bad film at all. Action-packed, a bit humorous, good acting, nice special effects, etc., etc., etc. But when you boil it all down, it's Terminator vs. Predator vs. Groundhog Day. I just don't understand what's going on in Hollywood... It's like all the screenwriters are dredging up movies they remembered when they were little kids and slapping them all together hoping somebody will think they're original. Groundhog Day's been done. Yeah, it was a comedy, but that doesn't mean you can lift the plot and stick it into a Sci-Fi Action blockbuster. Terminator's been done--and so has Alien (and wait until you see the enemy and then tell me they're not "Predator" clones). There's such a thing as homage and there's such a thing as outright theft in bad taste. You'll have to make the judgment on this one yourself.
tt1631867I'm not a Tom Cruise fan; I think his opinions are whacked. However I set aside my dislike of his ignorance and went to see this movie knowing full well that it was a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. The first item to cover is the "attention to detail" directors always seem to miss when creating movies. Time travel or any form of it is tricky and the director of this movie totally missed on a lot of little things. A lot! So many that this is all I'm going to say about it, but JHChrist, it bugs the crap out of me. The last thing I'll say is that copying the "Sentinels" from the Matrix movies is lame. Not only do the aliens look like them they sound like them. It's really silly and they could have come up with a better alien. Over all the movie was enjoyable but it doesn't even come close to sitting in my top 1,000 movies of all time. It's one of those movies that I see once, shrug my shoulders, then move on. I'll never want to watch it on the weekends when it pops up on prime time television. I'll never want to own the DVD and if some one gives it to me as a gift I'm going to try and return it. Direction 0 points Acting 1/2 point Special effects 1 point Script 1/2 point F/X 1/2 point Ending bonus points? I'll give 1 point for the last three minutes of the movie. I liked it. Total points 3.5
tt1631867Good action, obviously great graphics. The concept of the aliens was good both aesthetically and in the plot. Emily Blunt was great, Tom Cruise was okay. Brendan Gleeson's role was almost negligible. Too much humour spread in the movie, and not what I was looking for from the movie. The story was a bit predictable and stale, didn't really draw me in or make me feel much compassion for the characters. Some scenes seemed strictly for humour, with no contribution at all to the plot. Other than the alien scenes, most of the action scenes were included in the trailers. Glad I saw it in theatres for the visuals, but probably wouldn't recommend it and won't watch it again.
tt1631867Not really, because other than the idea that both films are based around the idea of the lead character living the same day over and over they are very different films. While not the biggest Tom Cruise fan as late, I did like MI4 but really didn't like Jack Reacher (insert your own joke here) I was very surprised how much I liked TC in this film. Without giving away too much, Mr. Cruise finds the power in which he may be able to win the war against an alien force (in which we don't learn too much about) but what we do know is that Cruise has a great arc and there are a few surprises along his journey. If you are a sci-fi fan this is a must see. The most surprising thing of all is what a great Director Doug Liman has become, from Swingers he's come along way baby. See for the effects, story and great characters.
tt1631867Edge of tomorrow is much action-packed movie than story&script in it,,,the time loop is little ridiculous,,,well director Doug Lyman may have handled that even better than this,,,in which the SOURCE CODE movie managed it(time loop)very well,,,when coming to the action the both leads Tom Cruise & Emily Blunt done their part to the 100% efficient,,, the alien race structure & figure is not so well crafted maybe it can be developed more than this,,,combat sequences are good but not so perfect,,,even the background score is not managed well BOTTOM LINE:- thus for the audience its better to go for the movie with low expectations !!!
tt1631867Roger Ebert once said "games will never be art", I would argue that films like this prove that most mainstream films don't qualify as art. The only surprise was how quickly the film did a 180 and went from a potentially new and interesting character for Cruise and a reversal of the hero heroin roles. There are plenty of examples in both the film and game world where, a successful endeavour spawns hundreds of cheap ripoffs, Edge at least has the distinction of not being cheap. Acting is fine, special effects are indeed special, but what I went looking for quickly descended into mediocrity and playing it safe. The film starts well, Cruise for once, isn't the typical hero, he is more an anti hero, I was expecting something intelligent from Hollywood for once, perhaps finally 14 years into the 21st century we might have a mainstream film where the male lead is rescued by the female lead, but looking back, I realise how incredibly naive that was, and I strongly suspect it will never happen. Given a choice main stream media will always choose the safe option, for fear of loosing money. Despite the fact that films make the vast majority of their money in the first few weeks of release, and most people make their choice to see or buy regardless of other peoples opinion, so a risk wouldn't really be a risk. Despite this fact Edge ticks all the obligatory boxes, big name actor check, big budget check, special effects fest check, but a real opportunity for Cruise and main stream film making to challenge and grow was missed. Instead of an anti hero who has to rely on the woman, Cruise becomes the typical action man character he's always portrayed. Instead of a strong female lead that who isn't eclipsed by her co star, she's there as love interest. The biggest let down was the last 20 minutes, where the matrix ripoffs came thick and fast. Plot descended quickly between expendable extras who presence was barely needed, Cruise suddenly able to take bone crushing, organ squishing injuries in his stride, and the female lead deciding hes the one for her despite them only just having met. The ending made no sense and felt like the story had been rewritten to incorporate a happy ending that was never intended in the original script. The one thing that elevated it, was the script, good writing, with a few laughs and well rounded characters kept my interest, and it was only in the last few minutes of the film that this too lost credibility. All in all, I feel more let down because of the great start and great writing, which lifted my expectations. If the film hadn't relied so heavily on clichés and unoriginal choices towards the end this could have been a great film. If anyones listening, how about a directors cut, with an ending that better reflects the reality portrayed in the first half of the film.
tt1631867I was planning for the fdfs of Edge of Tomorrow, but due to my tight schedule, i've got that chance to watch it yesterday. Believe me, this is one of the most thrilling and spine chilling movie of the year. Tom Cruise looked young, and vibrant. His action moves were satisfying and engaging. But the main protagonist of the movie is the story and the screenplay. Stunning graphics, Explosive sound effects and chilling action made this movie to my favorite movie list. Story sounds little bit similar with Groundhog day even though, it wont make you bored because of the crisp editing and the narration. The graphics and sound effects helped the story to a large extent to make it Emily Blunt, she was amazing and looked beautiful in the movie. Doug Liman did a wonderful job. The movie A perfect 10 on 10
tt1631867That was my next to reflex reaction when reading the basic plot summery. So with some trepidations I decided to give it a shot and despite the fact that I think the ending is too Hollywoodian, I still find the film to be of a very high quality. It starts by presenting the leading character as a complete jerk (not to use stronger language), and I was really thinking, here goes another Groundhog Day, well I was wrong. It has a surprisingly solid plot, with solid movie reasoning, nothing is in the story without a purpose, and every minute on screen makes sense. This fact by itself, elevates the movie by a notch or two. The acting is superb, and Tom Cruise does deserves better recognition for his talents. Emily Blunt is even better, and both Brendan Gleeson and Bill Paxton are perfect in their roles. But the entire film simply leaves no plot holes I can think about, and for me that's a real refreshing change. When everything else is keeping up with the plot - that is, the characters, the acting the pacing the CG, well I thought it almost deserved another ending and I would've given it a perfect 10. But as it is, 9 will have to do.
tt1631867All of the ideas in the film are familiar and repeatedly used before in major Hollywood film but director Doug Liman has done a mix and match brilliantly by adapting from the original novel and then recombining the elements from The Source Code with alien invasion into something refreshing which audiences have not seen for a long time throughout the cinematic experience. While it starts off a bit slow with the usual style of mission impossible and a little bit of video game effects, it builds into a cool and thrilling adventure thanks to the great inspiring yet emotional chemistry between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. With addition of some smart dark humors, chilling action scenes, strong scores and stunning visual effects during repetitive death/ life, the film has turned out as a successful and entertaining science fiction for this summer.
tt1631867Cage (Cruise) is put on a suicide mission to defend the planet from an invading race of aliens. Before dying on the beaches of Normandy with the rest of mankinds soldiers he is caught in a time loop where he will "respawn" in England the day before the last desperate human attack on Normandy takes place. It is a pleasure to finally see Tom Cruise back in form in Edge of Tomorrow. Following a streak of mediocre sci-fi movies Cruise finally showed audiences why he is still considered one of the absolute top leading men in modern cinema. He certainly brings his A-game to the movie with an enthusiasm that we haven't really seen since Tropic Thunder, in a less tenacious but much more determined and unassuming fashion. He got great help from rising-star Emily Blunt who was sensationally stunning as the hard-hearted officer and Angel of Verdun. The chemistry between the two is what essentially sells the movie (together with tons of CGI and of course alien robots) and they sell it well. The repeated first-meetings between the two never gets old, we always want to see if Cage can somehow manage the fiery Rita better than last time. The film is functioning extremely well in the ever-growing grey-area between film and video game. We feel a close connection to Cage because we are the only ones that know and can identify what he is going through. It is always a movies job to make the audience identify with the protagonist, and Edge of Tomorrow does so effortlessly and elegant. The structure takes us on a unique journey with Cage were we follow him every time he has to reset and we feel his distress when he got close before he was reset. Fans of difficult campaigns in the FPS gaming genre will find the elements reset and restart very familiar as the whole aspect of "move forward, die, move a little further, die, etc.etc.etc.) Is almost always very prevalent in that genre. This is all exemplified and enhanced by the short exchange between Cage and Rita - "What do we do now?" "I don't know, we have never gotten this far". As opposed to "Gamer" this works out very well for Edge and the audience never feels let out of the action and the storyline is much easier to follow than the grossly mismatched trailer might let you to believe.
tt1631867I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and I've seen a few "time-loop" kind of movies so it wasn't that shocking of a thing. This movie wasn't extraordinarily different than those other ones, but I really liked it. I have nothing bad to say about it. At first, things were moving kind of slow, I was a bit confused, and it seemed kind of plain. But along the course of events, characters show more depth and the movie gets more interesting, which is what to be expected in a movie! While I was watching it I wasn't really judging the production of the film, but rather just watching, paying attention, and enjoying it. However, looking back at it, I do think it was nicely executed! The story was nicely told. I did find myself full of suspense at some points and invested in the characters. The actors did great jobs! For the storyline, I kind of expected that kind of storyline. As events unraveled, I just predicted some things. For me, it wasn't completely like "woah so unexpected" but it wasn't boring or generic. They also pulled out some things that made me go "WAIT WHAT." So I'd say it was pretty enticing. This movie left me satisfied and happy with everything. It's not one of those movies that I super duper love and keep it close to my heart or anything, but I did really like it and have nothing bad to say about it!
tt1631867I had expected "Edge of Tomorrow" to be good based on a certain level of buzz I'd heard (something I typically try to avoid since I prefer to go into the theater with an objective eye). But what I didn't see coming, was for it to exceed what expectations I did have. This is way more than an action SF film. Indeed, this is as much a science fiction mystery/war drama as anything. The story has plenty of action to help sell it for international audiences but the plot development is clever and subverts expectations resulting from audience familiarity with Groundhog Day. How it subverts those expectations would be a spoiler but suffice to say that writer, Christopher McQuarrie, builds a very sophisticated approach to the time loop concept that Groundhog Day never explored. Cruise carries the film with a performance that reminded me of his efforts in Vanilla Sky (probably his best acting ever) and Minority Report. He has to evolve as a character through the course of the film and does so believably. Of course, Cruise has had a series of exceptional outings over the last few years with MI:3, Valkyrie, MI: Ghost Protocol, Jack Reacher, and Oblivion. Those well-considered script choices over the last decade (with the exception of Lions For Lambs and Knight and Day) are reason enough to check out EoT. But if you need another excuse: Emily Blunt. She and Cruise develop a special chemistry despite the compressed time-frame the movie has to work inside of. The dramatic elements were well written and acted, the SF mystery components were air tight, the time loop aspects were masterfully executed, and the boy/girl story was surprisingly poignant. Then there was the action. What I especially liked about these sequences were that they moved the story along instead of being the typical Hollywood action set pieces that play out nonsensically in recent films like Transformers [# take your pick], Iron Man 3, The Hobbit: DoS, or Godzilla. Rather, here we see battle scenes in a war and these scenes are necessary to advance the plot (rather than bring it to a halt). A final thought; it's not giving anything away to say that the Cruise character, Cage, dies several times during the course of the story. Those deaths are NOT funny and many are tragic. But for some reason, several immature people in the theater audience laughed out loud at those moments, even though they were never played for laughs. If you have not seen the film, I recommend it highly but please don't laugh in inappropriate places in the film. Other people will think you're an imbecile. Thanks in advance and enjoy!
tt1631867Remember Oblivion? Chances are you don't. It was a poor Sci-Fi blockbuster released last year, in which mankind has left the planet after a war with aliens, and now Tom Cruise is harvesting the last natural resources. Or so he thinks, as things are not what they appear to be. Apart from Cruise, the movie co-starred Tom Cruise as several clones of the protagonist. A cynic might be inclined to think Edge of Tomorrow repeats Oblivion's mistakes, and he would not be fully wrong. Edge of Tomorrow, too, has a messy plot involving aliens in which Cruise dies multiple times, at which point Cruise takes over. However, Edge of Tomorrow utilizes a more tongue-in-cheek approach to its overall plot to underscore the absurdity of the situation. Good thing too, as it is indeed all quite laughable. Too bad such a tone does creep in eventually, to the film's detriment. Edge of Tomorrow is set in a future where a strange extraterrestrial enemy has conquered all of Europe and threatens to do likewise to the rest of the globe. Earth's nations have banded together in an attempt to fight off the adversary. All their battles were lost, save for one, where metal armoured female soldier Rita Vrataski made the difference. By applying similar combat harnesses to every soldier and sending them en masse to invade France, humanity hopes to retake the continent and annihilate the enemy. Of course, things are not as simple as they seem, and the aliens have a few tricks up their sleeve yet. For one thing, time loops. Enter Cruise, who does an unusual thing here: he plays against character. Cruise is not starring as the monotonously brave action hero, but instead as a cowardly marketing agent for the military, who finds himself accused of desertion when he makes it clear he doesn't feel like covering the invasion to a stern general's face. Thrown in with a bunch of ragtag recruits, Cruise is dragged off to battle and left to fend for himself. He quickly kicks the bucket in a close skirmish with one of the vicious aliens. Then he wakes up back at base, and everything starts over again, much to his dismay as he doesn't do better the second time. Or the third. Try convincing your commanding officer of being stuck in a time loop ad infinitum. Needless to say he doesn't, so Cruise must find a way to discover what has happened to him and how to use it to his advantage, instead of continue dying without end. So far so good, as the notion of time looping is handled with enough confidence and fun not to feel repetitive. In fact, repetition is cleverly avoided after the first few loops, as Cruise's character tries to alter events in different ways so as not to get boring. This approach too causes problems in the long run, as Cruise dies so many times (hundreds, if not thousands, it is suggested) that the plot soon trots along and seemingly ignores the whole concept, just to further the intricate story. The reason behind the time loops and the method of fighting its cause start to become so convoluted and ridiculous that the ingredient of fun which at first characterized it is ever more lost. What's worse, Cruise resorts to playing a more typical heroic role as the film progresses, while it's the sleaze bag aspect that initially made him interesting to watch. At least his chemistry with the tough but unapproachable Rita is watchable enough as long as the Hollywood romance looming in the background is kept at bay. In terms of acting, Paxton's cocky performance suits the tone of the film best, which makes it all the more regrettable that when he's out of the picture, Edge of Tomorrow schizophrenically feels the need to get serious. Naturally it includes an all too predictable 'what the F!' type ending that suggests you need to think things over, but doesn't make you care enough to do so. Until that time there's enough to make the viewing experience passable at best. Aside from Paxton, Blunt does her bit with plenty of pizazz, rife with entertainingly flamboyant demeanour. Nevertheless, it's the grandiose battle scenes that demand the most attention, as Edge of Tomorrow makes it progressively clear it intends to be an action movie more than the self aware comedy it initially appeared, until the comic elements are just discarded entirely. The notion of a futuristic landing on the beach of Normandy where men in armour fight weird creatures, proves hard to resist, but its execution is flawed. Often it's not easy to make out what is transpiring, mostly due to the chaotic camera work, which does make the fights seem more realistic. The design of the aliens doesn't help, as they keep moving about which makes it hard to see them as something other than a shapeless bunch of tentacles rolling around. It enhances the sense of battle immersion, but makes it difficult to appreciate the craftsmanship that went into designing what might have been epic war scenes. Edge of Tomorrow is a definite step up from the forgetful Oblivion, but still a far cry from, say, Minority Report, which also starred Cruise. The movie sadly switches tones halfway through, without securing the audience's allegiance to accept this. Worse, the more the plot progresses, the harder it is for the audience to remain focused, as things have to be taken with too big a grain of salt, while the good humoured use of loops ultimately gets lost in an overly incoherent plot. Cruise pleasantly surprises the spectator at first, before reverting to his standard performance. You could state his career is caught in a similar loop; minor variations do occur, but he always reverts to his established routine.
tt1631867Of Cruise's several recent science fiction roles, including "Minority Report", "War of the Worlds" and "Jack Reacher", "Edge of Tomorrow" ranks as one of his better offerings. Even some of the later Mission:Impossible installments are not as strong as this latest action-SF thriller. The one issue with this film is that if I describe the main plot line, all future viewers' cinematic experiences will be spoiled beyond repair. I will offer only some basic premises and refrain with giving away the main plot twist which occurs early in the film. Tom Cruise plays Lieutenant Cage, a former ROTC student at University who ends up producing advertisements for the US military. Extra-terrestrial baddies, sort of a cross between "Predator" and "Alien" with the speed of the parasitic "Alien" creatures who impregnate unsuspecting human beings, have infiltrated the world and threaten to exterminate all human existence. We learn from the get-go that humankind and "baddiekind" have already engaged in several confrontations. Cage has gone on a television campaign to recruit the best and the brightest to fight the baddies. Cage is then summoned to Europe and learns from a gung-ho Scottish/British commanding officer, General Brigham, that the latest military operation is to throw everything the international military has at the beasties on the western front of France, sort of an SF reenactment of D-Day near the beaches of Normandy. The General wants Cage to command the mission. Cage declines siting as his excuse that he's only an officer in name, but not really a soldier. And besides he's in the US military, and not under British or European jurisdiction. However, he finds he has been put under the general's command and after trying to weasel his way out of military service, Cage is forced to become a low-level combat soldier. He becomes, in a sense, his own recruitment. Thrust into the middle of regular enlisted men and women who use large body armor suits, similar to the one used by Ripley in "Aliens", Cage engages the battle with other soldiers. The battle turns out to be a route in favor of the alien baddies since they appeared to know every step and every move the humans made during the combat even before they made it. And then towards the end of the battle, a strange circumstance pivots Cage into another reality of sorts, the details of which I will fore-go revealing lest I be banned from writing further reviews on IMDb.com! And this is actually where the story really begins... A very satisfying cinematic SF experience. The film has an excellent balance between action and a compelling storyline. Cruise is excellent at pulling his viewers with him where he wants to go, provided it's a compelling script, which "Edge of Tomorrow" is. Emily Blunt plays a fellow soldier, far more seasoned in the "ready aim" department than Cruise, and the two achieve good chemistry. I will mention, by the way, Blunt's character's name is Rita. Interestingly, another film, whose main character has a similar dilemma to the one experienced by Cage has a female lead character, also name of Rita. This is essentially the SF equivalent of that other film, which shall remain nameless.
tt1631867Edge Of Tomorrow is one of the best movies of the summer so far... It has great elements adding up to equal a great movie. Acting was not an issue at all, Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt did a tremendous job in this movie. I am usually not a fan of futuristic kind of movies, but it had great suspense like in Source Code and some comedy like Groundhog Day. It had great action scenes featuring aliens that were WAY cooler than the aliens in Tom Cruise's 'War of the Worlds'. If you like plenty of suspense, action sequences, aliens, explosions... then you're in for a treat with this one. I would go see it, it's not as bad as you may think. Some of the scenes are questionable, and the ending is a tad bit confusing but for the most part... it was a great story and a great movie. We will see if Michael Bay can top this one.
tt1631867It is difficult for me to rate this film. First of all it is well acted and with decent special effects. The idea is interesting even if not terribly original and the film is well made. However, the movie has the problems commonly associated with "Groundhog Day" movies: it has to show you the repetition in time of certain events, even if you got the idea from the first two shots. All the time paradoxes are, again, an issue in cases like this. Then it has the problems commonly associated with invasion movies: aliens are immensely powerful, but childish in their intelligence, feral and inhuman and impossible to communicate with in a decent manner and they also have some common source of their power which can be destroyed so they would be defeated. Don't worry, I am not spoiling anything, you know everything I just wrote from the first quarter of the film, but you still have to watch the rest of the film to actually see it. So, in conclusion, a well made film that brings almost nothing new to the table. Based on the level of the details that you like, you can make the story into a small episode in a series, a movie or an entire season of something, however the basic premise and what you effectively learn from it remains the same. It left me with a strange feeling because I both enjoyed it pretty much, but I also got that nasty cliché feeling all the time while seeing it. I recommend it, but don't expect too much.
tt1631867This movie is like a sci-fi Groundhog's Day in many regards. I have been a great fan of the formula. Especially in the 90s, it was sort of required that every TV show has it. Xena, Stargate SG-1, Buffy are some memorable examples. The formula is this: a person gets stuck in a time loop for some reason. The only way he / she can get out of it is by solving why they got into the loop, and changing something about their life. It usually requires learning some new ability as well. A problem that this formula can have is that it becomes boring after a while. I remember that the Xena episode had this problem, because she was doing the same thing too much. Stargate changed this by putting some funny elements into it, like when O'Neil played golf at the Stargate. What this movie did to keep it from boring was the huge learning curve that Cage (Tom Cruise) went through, and his romance with Rita (Emily Blunt). The story itself is not boring at all. From the trailer we can gather that it's about an alien invasion. We don't get to see the actual aliens for a while at the beginning, and the anticipation is a real adrenalin rush. The loops were done in an interesting way, and even a bit of humour was put into it. The explanation for the loop didn't seem too far fetched. In many regards, Cage is a classic Tom Cruise character. He flies a helicopter. He rides a bike. He has a gun. He wears a uniform. He broads in a pub with a drink. He is the hero. Cage does have character development, because while he starts out as a man concentrating on survival, he becomes someone who knows that sacrifice is the most likely outcome for the good of all. Rita is kick-ass character. I really loved her a lot, and Emily was great at it. I haven't seen her do an action movie before, okay, maybe Looper, but her character was different there. I really thought she stole the show for me. Overall, a really enjoyable movie. It has some surprises that I didn't see coming, which is pretty unusual. I recommend it not just for sci-fi, but also plain action movie fans. The romance is not too much, barely there actually.
tt1631867In the future, where an alien invasion is taking place, William Cage(Tom Cruise) is killed in battle with the aliens, but some of the alien gets on him, he then finds himself in a time loop, where the day keeps repeating itself every time he is killed. Can Cage figure out how too defeat the aliens in time? Tom Cruise plays it pretty well, not totally playing it has a straight laced action hero, but at times has a goof ball. Emily Blunt is also great, as a tough female soldier who teams up with Cruise, I hope she plays more action roles in the future, not to mention she and Cruise have great chemistry. The rest of the supporting cast are pretty memorable also. The effects are great also, I know since Groundhog Day(1993) this premise of the day repeating itself has been done to many times, but Edge of Tomorrow does it quite clever.
tt1631867This movie is pure fun but also purely common. As a science fiction enthusiast I give applause to Cruise, lending his fame to the advancement of science fiction based movies, the ideas of a united humanity, though only produced consequently against a subdued violence against a more powerful alien life form. Visually you will be entertained through on screen jokes of the re-live factor as the movie premise, humored as well by the rapture of Emily Blunt fresh take and salvaging betrayal of action star warrior galore. However passed the reoccurring nightmare that is Major William Cage, the theme of war amongst extra-terrestrial life as seen here, Cruise's Oblivion, War of the Worlds, film again, focuses on the uninteresting, personal journey of Cage accepting truth that we are not alone in the face of annihilation. It would be nice perhaps a bit inventive, to see a science fiction movie return to its glory beyond the scope of war solely as human inevitable fight for existence and enter the realm of creativity, examinations of enlightened sentient being outside the arena of the nostalgia gun blazing, tiring struggle, fight, and conquer. See Contact, Jupiter Ascending Trailer, Interstellar.
tt1631867I WANTED this movie to be great, as it was my most anticipated movie of this season. It did not disappoint. A very interesting story and plot device gave way to a "Groundhog Day" effect that worked well and was engaging as well as surprising. Going through the day the first time once with Cage (Tom Cruise) is interesting because you know you are going to experience many different facets and viewpoints of this day throughout the movie and upon doing so, it was very entertaining and amusing to me. I didn't know what to expect from the antagonists, and although nothing too creative or new is present here with the aliens. You don't get a view of them for a while, and you don't get many views, but it's also not a horribly cheesy addition to the film. The creative time/alien part of the film has some flaws, but if you don't over think it and can suspend reality for a bit, you should not be disappointed.
tt1631867It's technically proficient, has a lot of interesting ideas, is a smart film with occasional humor that delivers in many areas. Very good...and yet... I staggered out of the theater feeling like I'd been run over by a train. If this is entertainment, then I have to find something else to do with my time. Extremely dark, even though it wasn't gratuitous. Is this the signature of today's movies, that I feel worse coming out than when I went in? Cruise gives a superb performance, with a wide range of emotions. From the first scenes, we're with him, a smart and witty guy thrust into horrible situations that are over his head. But Emily Blunt is resoundingly one-note. She's great at anger, determination, scorn. She's driven. But she's not magnetic. If she'd shown another side for even a few frames, I would have sensed some depth, would have found her interesting. As is, she was as intriguing as one of their battle suits, moving around a lot and killing everything in sight but basically just hardware.
tt1631867Where the logic of this movie collapses as an all out war between Aliens and the Earth involving the US and it's allies, Russia and it's allies and China and it's allies, is the complete absence of Russia and China in the movie beyond minor mentions, thus tending to create a lack of depth in this conflict. Next up of course was a complete and total lack of fire support in the movie, no tanks, no helicopter gunships, no fighters, no bombers and, no artillery. This is the second battle, Verdun being the first just barely mentioned, which they apparently won but yet a sea and airborne invasion is required, so they must have lost since. Obviously this was done to accommodate the plot to focus upon specific individuals within the story rather than having them disappear with in mechanised, support and air combat. Unfortunately this tends to distort and shrink the conflict, so no longer a final major battle for the earth but more a smaller battle involving direct infantry conflict in non-protective power assist suits (I assume the suits lack armour so that you can see the actors better). This of course enables the movie to be stretched out rather than having an artillery, missile, fighter bomber assault upon the appropriate target, one tiny tactical nuke and it's all over and it allows the bad guy aliens to run around viscously stabbing things with their tentacles. Basically Battle for Los Angeles meets ground hog day. Beyond that not to badly done with good special effects, reasonable acting and, reasonable writing.
tt1631867How often do you see a well made movie less on entertainment factor.This is a premier example. Basic plot is a mixture of some alien flick and source code. It's basically a re-birth story with memory of older birth. Tom-cruise is superb,so is the other cast. C G I effects are amazing. Story moves intelligently and briskly with very little tiring moments. Yes there are some tiring moments which could have been filled. End is satisfying and second could be in making. So,If you are an out an out action movie buff. This is it !!
tt1631867Even though you see the lead actors dying, you don't mind it since they live again and again and again. Plus they are two beautiful people whom we all love - Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt! :) It is a Sci-Fi movie based on a Japanese novel - All you need is kill. After being killed by the alien enemy, Cage (Tom) develops the ability to see what will happen tomorrow, until he dies. Then he wakes up/lives again to repeat the process. He continues to do so until he perfects the art of killing the enemy, an alien kind creature who also has the ability to see the future. Cage meets Rita (Emily) who tells him that she also has been having similar dreams/visions. Deal was to get killed if things were not getting the way they wanted, instead of stay bleeding. Even when it sounds a little complicated, it is not. It actually gets very very funny. Humour to such an extent that I will put this movie in 'Humour Sci-Fi', if at all there is such an category. Something new happened in this movie - The 3D effects were really good and amazed me at regular intervals. Yes, I am saying this! Unlike all other 3D movies which I have complained about, this one was good. I have watched 3D movies in Inox, PVR and Cinepolis. The winner for best 3D glasses/effects is Cinepolis. Hands down. Like a typical sci-fi movie Edge of Tomorrow has action, drama, comedy, thrill and suspense. It will keep you on the edge of your seat - either making you laugh out loud or out of sheer thrill and suspense. Clearly the winner is the script/plot. Graphics are truly world class and acting is superb - well, it has to be. It's Tom Cruise after all! I suggest you go for it. NOW! Confession: I went with an exception that it would be another been-there-seen-that kind of typical American-soldiers-saves-the-world kinda movie but I was pleasantly surprised.
tt1631867I saw this movie at the cinema and I must say I really enjoyed the movie I thought it was very entertaining and very action packed. I like Tom Cruise and Emily blunt and I thought they gave good performances. Tom cruise was a cool leading man and I thought Emily blunt was a badass she kicked allot of ass and she took no Crap from anyone in this movie especially the aliens I thought she was a very cool and likable Character. Tom cruise was also cool and likable and kicked ass and he proved no one should mess with him. I found the story of the film interesting and some of the ideas I thought were original. The film is about the human race being at war with aliens called mimics the human race has been at war with them for five years and never won against them so they create these metal suits to fight the aliens in. The film really sucked me in and I found it very engaging and the action was great!.if people like action and sci-fi this is definitely the film for them because this film has explosions and gun fights and at times the film felt Epic! and I love these kind of movies. Now does this film have problems yes but they are small ones like a lack of character development and the beginning of the film was a little slow but once the action kicks in the film just keeps going! And from there on it never stops. I liked the idea of this movie that Tom cruise has to relive the same day of his life over and over again and he gets caught in a time loop and every time he dies he comes back to the beginning of the day before the Invasion but every time he comes back he gets stronger and more experienced at combat.The aliens have the power to create this time loop and they know everything the humans are going to do before they do. Emily blunts character knows about this time loop too because the same thing has happened with her and she tries to help Tom cruise become stronger and she trains him and I liked the relationship between them, at first they don't know each other much but Tom cruise starts to like her which I thought was nice. I liked that the aliens had the power to foresee their attacks it was a cool idea and that's what makes them so hard to beat,they were very tough enemy's and I also liked the design of the aliens they looked very cool and they were very menacing and strong and the special effects were very good too,I barely saw any cgi they looked like practical Creatures.to sum things up I thought the film had some very good ideas and great action scenes,the film was definitely adrenaline pumping and intense! and there was Never a dull moment so if people love badass over the top action and cool creatures definitely check out this film,I thought it was a very good film.
tt1631867Edge of Tomorrow gives you almost two hours of really good excitement! Edge of Tomorrow is exiting and have a good story that bring up new elements through the movie. You kinda loose the time in real life because you almost always see the same story in the movie, it's just a bit changed each time. It's good, because you enjoy the movie all the time and you feel like you live in the movie each time he starts over again. The chance you will like this movie is huge, because people these days like this kind of movies that have action, thriller, a cute badass girl the boys love, a handsome protagonist the girls love, a lot of vfx, good graphics and a really good story. The movie tries to teach us something important, it is shown in the movie that you have to live the life you have, because you might not have 300 extra life as the protagonist, when it is the last life he have that count's the most. The scenes is wonderful, the vfx are really fine and the characters play their roles good. They have removed a part of the violence in the war to make a bit more child friendly. Some people says it have a original story and is not based on any other movie. I do not agree to that because you can find parts from the movie to other movies like Source Code, where both protagonist is sent back in time to prevent a horrible future. What i did not like with the movie is that it is a watch once time movie and then it will be a fine DVD/Blu-Ray standing in your collection. You can watch this movie once or twice, but it is not a movie you will watch several times again and again and again. A bit fact from the real life. They attack on a beach like the D-Day in World War 2. The movie was released on the year and almost on the day, 70 years after the D-Day. The country they was attacking on the beach was France in the movie. In WW2 was the attack on France too.
tt1631867Not just for the masses this one, and its a fantastic trend to see big studios put their faith in talented film-makers to churn out thoughtful cinema in the mainstream milieu. Emily Blunt can do no wrong, and with this, Liman can be forgiven 'Jumper'. Cruise has always been serviceable, but this one's perhaps his best work in a long, long time (never doubt his sincerity - it shone through even in 'Oblivion'). Also, sci-fi, of the good variety, seems to fit Cruise like a second skin. I'm all for it if he manages to keep churning out flicks like this one. Quite a bit of thought has been put into the central macguffin, and though it does have a (kinda) cop-out of an ending, the journey there is enormously satisfying, perhaps to a fault. I know the nitpickers are out there trying to second-guess all the work that's gone on into this masterpiece of an action yarn, but I'm happy, and was along for the complete ride even though I was wiped out when I stepped in to watch this one (marathon meetings - don't ask). Everyone know the groundhog day motif on this one, so no spoilers there. But the reason for its existence was something more interesting than I'd have given credit for from its trailers (even 'Lost' copped out when it came to explaining away stuff, but this one's strangely satisfying on that score). I did Not see that coming, though the final denouement is not all that surprising, and is simple to a fault at the end of it all. The look of the film is suitably muted in keeping with the milieu and the context, but the converted 3D is some of the best I've seen on-screen thus far. I know the subtleties will be lost on most, but I had fun with all the depth on display, and for once, it was built from scratch, from an in-depth graphic novel that got turned into a suitably dense screenplay. Bill Paxton, after a long time, has got a real powerful supporting role to play, never mind 'Million Dollar arm'. With lesser screen time, and almost no action scenes to boast of, he owns each and every line he speaks. The action is supremely spectacular, and the CGI's so good that you won't know where reality ends and effects begin. Never in-your-face, used as much as its needed to be used. I've watched 'Days of future past' one time too many, but I know that I will enjoy re-watching this one over the next few weeks. And if someone was indeed wondering, the creature design for the aliens is very, very good. Suitably menacing, with almost 100% stopping power, though they're categorized differently for narrative purposes, each and every model is poison. With 'The Winter soldier', 'Days of future past' and this one, this summer's turned out to be one of the best for nerds and people who prefer a little meat with their bones. Always a welcome sight. Now, to 'Dawn of the planet of the apes'.
tt1631867A scared-of-the-war soldier (No, that wasn't a typo error) is forcibly thrown (literally) on a battle field where he has to play tag with aliens and bullets and you can guess the rest. Along the way he meets a girl whom everyone fondly calls "Full-metal-B**ch" (That wasn't a typo either). Together they are put in a time loop where they play the same day again and again and again until the director decides to call it a day (No extra points if the movie "Groundhog day" comes to your mind). Based on novel "All you need is kill", there is nothing much for the story department and to some extent the screenplay department can relax a bit for the same reason. But flavoring it in the Hollywood crucible with some star-powered cast, this movie has essentially become one of the best sci-fi in the recent times. Before you decide to vote against me, let me make my stand clear. I go into a sci-fi movie not expecting an Oscar performance or a classy screenplay. On the contrary I expect entertainment with some good-to- recall moments that will make my money worthwhile. Did the movie tick all the boxes, YES. Tom Cruise, as we all know, is Hollywood's go-to-guy when it comes to saving the world. Be it the Russians (in MI-4) or killer drones (in Oblivion) or the "mimics" (in this movie") he has seen them all and killed them all. When the Academy decides to offer an award on the "most kill category", we know who the front-runner is. OK, enough deviations. Edge Of Tomorrow (EOT) is nothing short of an adrenaline drive which doesn't take itself very seriously (which is a good thing) with its own light-hearted moments (For ex. The hero must die each time to reset the day and guess who does it most of the time). Though this dries up a bit towards the end, the story fills in the vacuum with touch-ups from the CG department. Some of you might be confused towards the end as to how the story shaped itself. But then it's the writer freedom to decide how his story must end. So, that's forgiven. Edge of Tomorrow: Will leave you on the edge of your seats.
